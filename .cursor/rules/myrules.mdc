üöÄ PRD: Code Execution Platform (HTML, CSS, JS)
1. üéØ Problem Statement

Learners often need a sandbox environment to quickly test and run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without installing anything locally. Current platforms (like CodePen, JSFiddle, etc.) are good but too broad, whereas you want a custom lightweight platform for learners that supports execution, sharing, and collaboration.

2. ‚úÖ Core Features
2.1 Editor

Three Panels: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (separate editors with tabs or side-by-side layout).

Code Editor Features:

Syntax highlighting

Line numbers

Auto indentation

Bracket matching

Optional: Autocomplete (using Monaco or CodeMirror).

2.2 Execution Engine

Live Preview (iframe-based rendering).

"Run" button to re-render code.

Auto-run toggle (optional for live update on typing).

2.3 Layout Management

Resizable panels (drag to resize HTML/CSS/JS/output).

Dark/Light mode toggle.

Mobile-friendly responsive design.

2.4 User Features

Save code snippets to account.

Share code via unique URL.

Fork existing snippets.

Export as .zip (HTML/CSS/JS).

2.5 Authentication (Phase 2, optional)

Login via email/password or Google OAuth.

Personal dashboard of saved snippets.

Public/Private snippet setting.

2.6 Collaboration (Phase 3, optional)

Real-time multiplayer editing (WebSockets / WebRTC).

Commenting system.

3. üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

4. Nice-to-Have Add-ons

Prebuilt templates (e.g., HTML boilerplate, CSS grid, JS DOM example).

Themes for the editor (like VS Code themes).

Code beautifier (Prettier integration).

Console panel for JS logs/errors.


7. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

HTML/CSS/JS Editor (with Monaco or CodeMirror).
